- [x] Fix FetchLifecycle tests -> probably make fetcher just return blobs
- [x] Remove fetcher -> create buildpacks retrieved via downloader (blobs)
- [x] Move buildpack to interface similar to lifecycle
- [x] Lifecycle EITHER version or uri, not both
- [ ] Lifecycle nothing older than v0.3.0
- [ ] Lifecycle: Move validate(expectedVersion) to where it's being called from (remove from interface)
- [ ] Move Version to a different package?
- [ ] Revisit Version pointer structure
- [ ] API version types?
- [ ] API versions in inspect-builder output (the actual story)
- [ ] Move buildpack validations to NewBuildpack
- [ ] Check project for TODO
